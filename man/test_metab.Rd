\title{(Data) Normalized metabolite abundances for MMINP prediction}
\format{
A data frame of metabolite relative abundances (i.e. proportion),
with 65 subjects in rows and 130 KEGG compound IDs in columns.
}
\description{
This datasets were built from NLIBD dataset (Franzosa et al., 2019) by
converting original HMDB IDs into KEGG compound IDs and removing
unassigned and repeated features.
