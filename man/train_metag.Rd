\title{(Data) Normalized gene family abundances for MMINP training}
\format{
A data frame of gene family relative abundances (i.e. proportion),
with 155 subjects in rows and 733 KEGG Orthology (KO) IDs in columns.
}
\description{
This datasets were built from PRISM dataset (Franzosa et al., 2019) by
converting original UniRef90 IDs into KEGG Orthology (KO) IDs and removing
unassigned and repeated features.
